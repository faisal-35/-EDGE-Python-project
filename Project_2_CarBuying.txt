Write a python program that helps a buyer to choose his desired car based on available cars of different models and parameters from a car shop. Consider the following while developing the python code:
1.	Car: This class will represent a car with its attributes (price, fuel efficiency, brand, etc.).
2.	CarShop: This class will represent the car shop that contains available cars.
3.	CarBuyer: This class will assist the buyer in choosing a car based on their preferences.
